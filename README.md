# analysis_of_liver_patient_dataset
--------------------------------------------
This project focuses on predicting liver disease using supervised machine learning techniques. Using the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes data from 583 patients in Andhra Pradesh, India, we aimed to reduce diagnostic delays between hospitals and pathology labs. The dataset was analyzed using three supervised classification algorithmsâ€”SVM, KNN, and Random Forest. These models were trained to classify whether a patient is likely to have liver disease based on key medical attributes. The goal was to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms and identify the most accurate model for real-time diagnostic support.

I was responsible for the entire code implementation and data analysis. This included cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, selecting relevant features, training the classification models, and tuning hyperparameters for improved performance. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns in the data and used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare the models. Through detailed visualization and model interpretation, I helped identify Random Forest as the most accurate classifier among the three. The results demonstrate how data mining can support medical decision-making and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
